I assign the variable df the values of the dataset. Then I used the boxplot function for behavNumVisits column values(with the "horizontal" option)

2#
First i created a variable called "pos_max"(position max) with the which.max function for "city" column values. After that, with other variable, "n", who received all "city" values, I printed the position max value in n!

3#
I only printed the difference between the mean of "behavNumVisits" and the media of "behavNumVisits"!

4#
Since I know python programming(It's similar, I think!), I use what make sense for me. For each values in "behavNumVisits"(FOR LOOP), if it is smaller than 5(razonable number of visits) will be appended to another variable called "answer". After that, as my 3# question resolution, "I only printed the difference between the mean of "answer" and the media of "answer"!
